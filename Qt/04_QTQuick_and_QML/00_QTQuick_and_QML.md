Chapter 4 of your Qt programming course, "Advanced GUI with Qt Quick and QML," explores the dynamic capabilities of Qt Quick for developing modern and responsive GUIs. This section introduces QML, the language used with the Qt Quick framework, to build highly interactive user interfaces. We will cover the basics of QML, the integration of C++ with QML, the use of standard components, and the development of custom components.

Chapter 4 provides an in-depth look at advanced GUI development with Qt Quick and QML, focusing on both standard and custom component creation to foster a practical understanding of dynamic UI development. This structure ensures students not only learn the theory but also how to apply these techniques in real-world applications.
