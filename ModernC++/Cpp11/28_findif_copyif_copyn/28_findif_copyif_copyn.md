`std::find_if_not`, `std::copy_if`, and `std::copy_n` are useful C++11 algorithms found in the `<algorithm>` header that allow you to perform specific operations on collections based on conditions or copy a specified number of elements. These functions provide powerful tools for processing collections in a more readable and efficient manner.

### Description

1. **`std::find_if_not`**:
   - **Purpose**: Finds the first element in a range that does not satisfy a predicate.
   - **Usage**: Useful for locating elements that do not match a given condition, which can be helpful in filtering out unwanted elements or finding exceptions in data sets.

2. **`std::copy_if`**:
   - **Purpose**: Copies elements from one range to another if they satisfy a specified predicate.
   - **Usage**: Useful for creating a new collection that only includes elements that meet certain criteria, commonly used in data filtering tasks.

3. **`std::copy_n`**:
   - **Purpose**: Copies the first `n` elements from one range to another.
   - **Usage**: Useful when you need to copy a specific number of elements, often used in scenarios where the number of elements to be processed is dynamically determined or fixed.

### Complex Example: Managing Employee Records

Imagine you're tasked with managing a list of employee records. You want to filter out employees based on specific criteria, find the first inactive employee, and copy a subset of employee records.

Let's define an `Employee` class and demonstrate how to use these algorithms for managing a list of these employees.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>

class Employee {
public:
    std::string name;
    int id;
    bool isActive;

    Employee(std::string name, int id, bool isActive)
        : name(name), id(id), isActive(isActive) {}
};

int main() {
    std::vector<Employee> employees {
        Employee("Alice", 1, true),
        Employee("Bob", 2, false),
        Employee("Charlie", 3, true),
        Employee("David", 4, false),
        Employee("Eve", 5, true)
    };

    // Find the first inactive employee
    auto it = std::find_if_not(employees.begin(), employees.end(), [](const Employee& e) {
        return e.isActive;
    });
    if (it != employees.end()) {
        std::cout << "First inactive employee: " << it->name << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "All employees are active." << std::endl;
    }

    // Copy active employees to a new vector
    std::vector<Employee> activeEmployees;
    std::copy_if(employees.begin(), employees.end(), std::back_inserter(activeEmployees), [](const Employee& e) {
        return e.isActive;
    });

    // Display active employees
    std::cout << "Active employees:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& emp : activeEmployees) {
        std::cout << emp.name << std::endl;
    }

    // Copy first 3 employees to another vector
    std::vector<Employee> firstThree;
    std::copy_n(employees.begin(), 3, std::back_inserter(firstThree));

    // Display first three employees
    std::cout << "First three employees:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& emp : firstThree) {
        std::cout << emp.name << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points

- **`std::find_if_not`** is used to find the first inactive employee. It iterates over the list and returns the first employee whose `isActive` status is false.
- **`std::copy_if`** copies only active employees into a new vector, which can be used, for example, to send notifications or updates specifically to active staff.
- **`std::copy_n`** copies the first three employees from the original list into another list, which could be used in scenarios like generating reports for meetings or audits.

This example showcases practical usage of these algorithms in a typical administrative application, such as handling a database of employees, filtering data, and preparing subsets of records for processing.
