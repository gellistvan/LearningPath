# Modern C++ features
## C++11

C++11, often referred to as "C++0x" during its development, was a major update to the C++ language that introduced a wide range of features that significantly changed how C++ could be written. It introduced modern C++ features aimed at making C++ safer, faster, and easier to use. Hereâ€™s a detailed list of the features added in C++11:

### Core Language Features
1. **auto and decltype** - Automates type deduction in variable declarations and infers type from expressions, respectively.
2. **defaulted and deleted functions** - Allows explicit declaration of default or disabling specific compiler-generated functions (constructors, destructor, etc.).
3. **final and override** - `final` prevents subclasses from overriding a method; `override` ensures a function overrides a base class method.
4. **trailing return type** - Enables the specification of the return type of a function at the end of the function signature using `auto`.
5. **rvalue references** - Introduces a reference type that can bind to temporary objects, enabling efficient resource transfer.
6. **move constructors and move assignment operators** - Special member functions that transfer resources from one object to another, avoiding copying.
7. **scoped enums** - Strongly typed enums that prevent implicit conversions and provide better scoping.
8. **constexpr and literal types** - Allows expressions to be evaluated at compile time, facilitating constant expressions.
9. **list initialization** - Uniform syntax for initializing any type including arrays and containers.
10. **delegating and inherited constructors** - Constructors that can call other constructors within the same class or base class constructors respectively.
11. **brace-or-equal initializers** - Allows use of braces or equals to initialize class member variables.
12. **nullptr** - Type-safe pointer literal that replaces NULL in pointer contexts.
13. **long long** - Integral type that guarantees at least 64 bits of storage.
14. **char16_t and char32_t** - Types for Unicode characters representing UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding units.
15. **type aliases** - Provides a syntax via `using` for creating type synonyms, more flexible than typedef.
16. **variadic templates** - Templates that accept a variable number of arguments, enabling more flexible function and class templates.
17. **generalized (non-trivial) unions** - Unions that can include non-trivial data types, like classes with constructors and destructors.
18. **generalized PODs (trivial types and standard-layout types)** - Relaxes restrictions on POD (Plain Old Data) types, aiding in compatibility with C structures.
19. **Unicode string literals** - Allows strings in Unicode formats to be written directly in code using prefixes like `u`, `U`, and `u8`.
20. **user-defined literals** - Permits the definition of custom literals via operator"" prefix.
21. **attributes** - Standardized syntax for compiler and tool-specific annotations.
22. **lambda expressions** - Defines anonymous functions directly in the context of an expression.
23. **noexcept specifier and noexcept operator** - Specifies whether a function can throw exceptions and checks if an expression may throw exceptions.
24. **alignof and alignas** - Queries alignment requirements and specifies alignment constraints.
25. **multithreaded memory model** - Provides support for concurrent programming by introducing atomic operations, memory barriers, etc.
26. **thread-local storage** - Allows data to be unique to each thread.
27. **GC interface** - Proposed mechanisms for interaction with garbage collectors, removed in C++23.
28. **range-for** - A loop statement that iterates over all elements in a range, similar to foreach in other languages.
29. **static_assert** - Compile-time assertion check to validate template or constant expressions.

### Library Features
1. **Headers like `<array>`, `<atomic>`, etc.** - Introduce a suite of new functionalities such as fixed-size arrays, atomic operations, and utilities for thread synchronization and interaction.
2. **Concurrency support library** - Provides components for managing threads, mutual exclusions, condition variables, futures, and promises.
3. **emplace() and other use of rvalue references** - Optimizes container operations by constructing elements in-place.
4. **std::unique_ptr** - Smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes of that object when the unique_ptr goes out of scope.
5. **std::move_iterator** - An iterator adaptor that converts the values obtained from the underlying iterator into rvalues.
6. **std::initializer_list** - Allows functions to take a brace-enclosed list of values as a parameter.
7. **stateful and scoped allocators** - Enhancements to memory allocators that enable finer control over memory allocation strategies.
8. **chrono library** - Utilities for measuring time durations and system time points.
9. **ratio library** - Provides compile-time rational arithmetic support.
10. **New algorithms like `std::all_of`, `std::any_of`, etc.** - Extend algorithmic capabilities, offering more direct, readable solutions to common programming problems.
11. **Unicode conversion facets** - Facilitates conversions between different character encodings in a type-safe manner.
12. **std::function** - General-purpose polymorphic function wrapper.
13. **std::exception_ptr

** - A type-safe pointer that can manage an exception object.
14. **std::error_code and std::error_condition** - Types that represent system and library errors in a portable way.
15. **Iterator improvements** - Additional functions like `std::begin`, `std::end`, etc., that simplify manipulation of iterators.
16. **Unicode conversion functions** - Functions that assist with the conversion between Unicode character encodings.
