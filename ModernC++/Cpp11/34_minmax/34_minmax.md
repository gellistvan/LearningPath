In C++11, the Standard Library includes convenient functions `std::minmax` and `std::minmax_element` to help identify the minimum and maximum values in a pair or range, respectively. These functions are particularly useful when you need to quickly find both extremes in your data.

### Description

1. **`std::minmax`**:
   - **Purpose**: Returns a pair consisting of the lesser and greater of two values provided. If the values are equivalent, it returns a pair of the values as they appear.
   - **Usage**: Useful in scenarios where both minimum and maximum values are required simultaneously from a small set of values, often used in algorithm optimization, bounding calculations, or during initial setup checks.

2. **`std::minmax_element`**:
   - **Purpose**: Examines a range and returns a pair of iterators to the smallest and largest element in the range.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for efficiently locating both the minimum and maximum elements in a collection without needing multiple passes over the data, commonly used in statistical analysis, graphics (for bounding volumes), or any application where range boundaries are important.

### Complex Example: Analyzing Weather Station Data

Let's say you're analyzing data from a network of weather stations. Each station reports a daily temperature, and you're interested in quickly identifying the stations with the highest and lowest temperatures on a particular day, as well as directly comparing two temperatures.

### Implementation

Hereâ€™s how you could use `std::minmax` and `std::minmax_element` in this scenario:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

struct WeatherStation {
    std::string name;
    double temperature;

    WeatherStation(std::string name, double temperature)
        : name(name), temperature(temperature) {}

    void display() const {
        std::cout << name << ": " << temperature << " degrees Celsius" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<WeatherStation> stations {
        {"Station A", 15.5},
        {"Station B", 23.1},
        {"Station C", 17.6},
        {"Station D", 19.3},
        {"Station E", 21.8}
    };

    // Find the station with the lowest and highest temperature
    auto result = std::minmax_element(stations.begin(), stations.end(), 
                                      [](const WeatherStation& a, const WeatherStation& b) {
                                          return a.temperature < b.temperature;
                                      });

    std::cout << "Coldest station: ";
    result.first->display();
    std::cout << "Hottest station: ";
    result.second->display();

    // Compare two specific temperature readings directly
    double temp1 = 18.7;
    double temp2 = 22.4;
    auto minmaxTemp = std::minmax(temp1, temp2);
    std::cout << "Comparing temperatures: " << minmaxTemp.first << " (min), " << minmaxTemp.second << " (max)" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points

- **Weather Station Data Analysis**: The example uses a vector of `WeatherStation` objects, each with a name and a recorded temperature.
- **Finding Extremes**: `std::minmax_element` is used to find the coldest and hottest stations in one pass through the vector, which is efficient and effective for such analyses.
- **Direct Value Comparison**: `std::minmax` is used to compare two specific temperatures, demonstrating how these utilities can be used for straightforward comparisons.

This example demonstrates how `std::minmax` and `std::minmap_element` are applied in a realistic scenario to manage and analyze complex data structures efficiently, ensuring that operations are both clear and effective for real-world applications like environmental monitoring or data analysis.
