The `<thread>` header in C++11 is a significant part of the C++ Standard Library that introduces facilities for managing threads. It allows C++ applications to be written in a way that can take advantage of multi-core and multi-processor systems. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview:

### Contents of `<thread>` Header

1. **`std::thread` class**: This is the main class provided by the `<thread>` header. It represents a single thread of execution and provides mechanisms to start, stop, and manage threads. The `std::baux::thread` object must be either joined or detached before it is destructed, otherwise, the program will terminate.

2. **`std::this_thread` namespace**: This namespace contains functions that pertain to the thread of execution which calls these functions, such as:
    - `yield()`: Allows the current thread to offer the possibility of switching to another thread.
    - `sleep_for(duration)`: Blocks the current thread for the specified time duration.
    - `sleep_until(time_point)`: Blocks the current thread until a specified time point.

3. **Thread-related exceptions**:
    - `std::system_error`: Thrown when a thread operation fails due to a system-level error.

4. **`std::thread::id` class**: Provides a unique identifier for each thread. It can be compared and serves as a way to distinguish different threads.

### Uses and Advantages

- **Concurrency**: The primary use of the `<thread>` header is to enable concurrency in applications. By allowing multiple threads to run code simultaneously, you can achieve more efficient use of CPU resources and reduce overall execution time for programs.

- **Performance Optimization**: For CPU-bound applications, such as those performing intensive computations, threading can be used to parallelize the work across multiple cores, significantly speeding up the process.

- **Responsiveness**: In interactive applications (like GUIs), threading can be used to perform background tasks such as data loading or computations while keeping the user interface responsive.

### Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**: Always ensure that threads either join (`join()`) or detach (`detach()`) before they go out of scope. Failing to do so can lead to undefined behavior (typically, program termination).

2. **Exception Handling**: Since exceptions cannot cross thread boundaries, each thread should handle its own exceptions internally. Additionally, be aware of exceptions that might be thrown during thread construction (like `std::system_error`).

3. **Data Synchronization**: Access to shared data must be carefully controlled to avoid race conditions. Use mutexes, locks, or atomic operations to synchronize access.

4. **Thread Pool**: Instead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly, use a thread pool to manage available threads. This approach can greatly improve performance and resource utilization.

5. **Avoid Excessive Threading**: More threads do not always mean better performance. Thread creation and context switching have overheads, so the optimal number of threads often depends on the number of CPU cores and the nature of the task.

### When to Use

- **Multi-core Processing**: Ideal when your target system has multiple CPU cores that could be leveraged to perform parallel computations.

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Useful for executing background tasks that should not interrupt the main program flow, such as I/O operations or network communication.

- **High-Performance Computing**: Applications that require complex calculations and can be broken down into parallel tasks can benefit significantly from multi-threading.

The `<text>` header in C++11 has transformed how C++ developers can write efficient, powerful multi-threaded applications. Its facilities are crucial for modern software development, particularly in performance-sensitive and multi-user applications.
