The `<system_error>` header in C++11 includes functionality for handling and reporting errors related to system and library operations, which are often encountered during low-level programming. This header is a vital part of the C++ Standard Library's support for exception handling and reporting. Here's a detailed breakdown of the content provided by `<system_error>`:

1. **`std::error_code` Class:**
    - This is a platform-dependent error code. It encapsulates an error value (an integer) and a pointer to an `error_category`, which interprets the error value.
    - Methods include getters for the error value and category, comparison operators, and boolean checks.

2. **`std::error_condition` Class:**
    - Similar to `std::error_code`, but intended for portable error conditions. It also encapsulates an error value and a pointer to an `error_category`.
    - This class is used to represent error conditions that are independent of a specific system or library.

3. **`std::error_category` Class:**
    - This is an abstract base class that defines a category of errors. It provides a virtual destructor, and virtual functions for comparing error codes, creating error messages, and more.
    - Subclasses of `error_category` can customize the handling of error codes and messages.

4. **Concrete Error Categories:**
    - `std::generic_category()`: Returns a static reference to a generic error category for errors that are not specific to the operating system.
    - `std::system_category()`: Returns a static reference to a system error category for errors that come from the operating system.

5. **`std::error_condition` Make Functions:**
    - These functions create `error_condition` objects from error codes and categories.

6. **`std::is_error_code_enum` and `std::is_error_condition_enum` Templates:**
    - These are type traits used to determine if an `enum` is used to represent error codes or conditions. They allow enums to be automatically converted to `error_code` or `error_condition` objects.

7. **`std::errc` Enumeration:**
    - This is an enumeration that lists portable error condition values corresponding to POSIX error codes.

8. **`std::system_error` Class:**
    - A type of exception that can be thrown when a system-specific or generic error occurs. It is derived from `std::runtime_error`.
    - It includes an embedded `error_code` object.

9. **Comparison Operators:**
    - Overloads for comparing `error_code` and `error_condition` objects.

10. **Make Error Code/Condition Functions:**
    - Functions to create `error_code` or `error_condition` objects from error codes, categories, or other enums.

This header helps in developing robust applications by providing tools to manage and report errors efficiently, especially in environments where direct system-level access is necessary, such as file I/O, network operations, and hardware interaction.

The `<system_error>` header in C++11 is a robust facility designed to simplify error handling in C++ programs, particularly when interfacing with system-level resources or when writing library code that interacts with operating system functions. This header is crucial for managing errors uniformly across different systems and providing more contextual information about failures than traditional error handling methods, like returning error codes or using errno.

### Purpose and Utility

1. **Unified Error Handling:** The `<system_error>` header provides a standard way to represent and handle error conditions in a system-independent manner. Errors that occur in system-level operations (like file access, network communication, or threading) can be reported and managed uniformly.

2. **Exception Integration:** By integrating error codes with exceptions, it allows developers to throw and catch errors as part of the C++ exception handling mechanism, making error management both simpler and more powerful.

3. **Interoperability:** It helps in writing portable code that is not dependent on a specific platform's error system by abstracting error codes into categories.

### Key Components

- **Error codes and conditions:** These represent specific errors and more general error conditions. An `error_code` is typically tied to a specific system error, while an `error_condition` is more portable and general.

- **Error categories:** These categorize error codes and provide contextual messages. They also determine equivalency between error codes and conditions, helping to map system-specific errors to portable error conditions.

### Best Practices

1. **Use `std::error_code` for System-Level Functions:**
    - When writing functions that interface with system APIs or lower-level library functions, return `std::error_code` instead of throwing exceptions directly. This allows calling code to decide whether to handle the error explicitly or throw an exception.

2. **Throw `std::system_error` for Unrecoverable Errors:**
    - If an error is critical enough that the caller should not continue without handling it, throw a `std::system_error`. This exception can be caught by type, and the embedded `error_code` can be examined to determine the specific error.

3. **Leverage Portable Error Conditions:**
    - Use `std::error_condition` to write portable code that checks for general conditions (like `std::errc` enumerations) instead of specific error codes. This makes your code more robust across different platforms.

4. **Define Custom Error Categories:**
    - For library developers, defining custom error categories by extending `std::error_category` allows you to control how errors are reported and compared in your domain-specific context.

5. **Check and Convert Errors Carefully:**
    - Always check the results of operations that might fail by examining the returned `error_code`. Convert `error_code` to `error_condition` when you need to compare errors in a system-agnostic way.

### When to Use

- **System-Level Programming:** Anytime your code needs to handle errors from system or library calls (e.g., file operations, network sockets).
- **Cross-Platform Development:** When developing software intended to run on multiple operating systems, use `<system_error>` to abstract away platform-specific error handling.
- **Library Design:** When designing libraries that other developers will use, employing `<system_error>` can make the library easier to integrate with different types of applications, whether they use exceptions or more traditional error-checking mechanisms.

By adhering to these practices, developers can effectively use `<system_error>` to create robust applications that handle errors cleanly and maintain portability across different platforms.
