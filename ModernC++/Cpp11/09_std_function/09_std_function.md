The `std::function` class template in C++11 is part of the `<functional>` header and provides a way to store, manage, and invoke any Callable targetâ€”functions, lambda expressions, bind expressions, or other function objects, as well as pointers to member functions and data. This flexibility makes `std::function` very powerful, especially in scenarios involving high-level abstractions like callbacks, event handlers, and interfaces for generic programming.

### Description of `std::function`

`std::function` is a general-purpose polymorphic function wrapper. The instances of `std::function` can store, copy, and invoke any Callable target that can be called with the appropriate argument and return types. Essentially, it is used to abstract away different forms of callable entities into a single entity that can be used interchangeably.

### Prototype
```cpp
template< class >
class function; // undefined

template< class R, class... Args >
class function<R(Args...)>; // defined
```

### Example: Plugin System for a Simple Application

Let's consider a practical example where `std::function` is used to implement a plugin system for a simple application. In this system, plugins can register callback functions that perform specific tasks. This example demonstrates how `std::function` can be used to store and invoke these callbacks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>
#include <string>

// PluginManager class to manage callbacks
class PluginManager {
public:
    using PluginCallback = std::function<void(const std::string&)>;

    void registerPlugin(const PluginCallback& callback) {
        plugins.push_back(callback);
    }

    void runAll(const std::string& input) {
        for (const auto& plugin : plugins) {
            plugin(input);
        }
    }

private:
    std::vector<PluginCallback> plugins;
};

int main() {
    PluginManager manager;

    // Register a simple echo plugin
    manager.registerPlugin([](const std::string& data) {
        std::cout << "Echo Plugin: " << data << std::endl;
    });

    // Register a transform plugin
    manager.registerPlugin([](const std::string& data) {
        std::string transformed;
        for (char c : data) {
            transformed += std::toupper(c);
        }
        std::cout << "Transform Plugin: " << transformed << std::endl;
    });

    // Run all plugins with input
    std::string input = "Hello, Plugin World!";
    manager.runAll(input);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **PluginManager Class**:
   - A class designed to manage a list of plugins. Each plugin is represented as a `std::function` (aliased as `PluginCallback`) which takes a `std::string` parameter and returns void.
   - `registerPlugin` adds a new plugin to the internal list.
   - `runAll` executes all registered plugins with a given input string.

2. **Plugin Registration**:
   - The main function registers two plugins:
     - An echo plugin, which simply prints the input string.
     - A transform plugin, which converts the input string to uppercase and then prints it.

3. **Plugin Execution**:
   - The `runAll` method is called with a sample input string, triggering each registered plugin in sequence.

This example illustrates how `std::function` can be effectively utilized to create flexible systems where different functionalities can be dynamically added and managed, such as a plugin architecture. It enables the separation of concerns, decouples the execution logic from implementation, and provides a means to handle different types of callable entities through a uniform interface.
