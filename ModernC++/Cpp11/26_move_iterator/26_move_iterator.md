The `std::move_iterator` in C++11 is a type of iterator adapter that converts a regular iterator into an iterator that moves elements rather than copying them. This is particularly useful when you want to transfer elements from one container to another, and you want to avoid unnecessary copying of resources that could instead be moved, especially for objects that manage resources like dynamic memory, file handles, or network connections.

### Description

`std::move_iterator` wraps an existing iterator and modifies its behavior so that when dereferenced, it returns an rvalue reference (`T&&`) to the element pointed to by the original iterator. This makes it possible for algorithms that use the iterator to move elements instead of copying them.

Here's a breakdown of how `std::move_iterator` works:
- **Construction**: It is constructed from a regular iterator.
- **Dereferencing**: When the `std::move_iterator` is dereferenced, it returns a temporary (rvalue reference) to the element, enabling move semantics.
- **Incrementing/Decrementing**: It behaves like the underlying iterator, navigating through the elements as usual.

### Example Usage

Consider a situation where you have a vector of strings and you want to move these strings into another vector. Using `std::move_iterator` can be beneficial as it prevents copying of strings and directly moves them, which is more efficient.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> source {"apple", "banana", "cherry"};
    std::vector<std::string> destination;

    // Reserve enough space to avoid reallocations
    destination.reserve(source.size());

    // std::make_move_iterator creates a move iterator from a normal iterator
    std::move_iterator<std::vector<std::string>::iterator> begin(source.begin());
    std::move_iterator<std::vector<std::string>::iterator> end(source.end());

    // Use std::copy to "move" elements from source to destination
    std::copy(begin, end, std::back_inserter(destination));

    // Check the results
    std::cout << "Source (moved-from state):" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& s : source) {
        std::cout << '"' << s << "\" ";  // strings are in a valid but unspecified state
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Destination:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& s : destination) {
        std::cout << '"' << s << "\" ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points
- After moving the elements, the original elements in the `source` vector remain in a valid but unspecified state, meaning they can be reassigned or destroyed safely, but their actual content is not specified.
- The `std::copy` algorithm works with `std::move_iterator` to perform moves instead of copies, which can significantly optimize performance for types that support move semantics.

This example showcases how `std::move_iterator` effectively leverages move semantics provided by C++11 to optimize resource management in container operations.
