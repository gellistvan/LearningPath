In C++11, two useful features were introduced to enhance the flexibility and reduce redundancy in class constructors: delegating constructors and inherited constructors. These features simplify the process of constructor management in complex class hierarchies by allowing constructors to reuse other constructors' implementations within the same class or from a base class. Here's a detailed look at both features:

### Delegating Constructors

Delegating constructors allow a constructor to call another constructor in the same class, facilitating code reuse and reducing duplication. This is particularly useful when multiple constructors of a class share common initialization code.

#### How it Works:
- **Purpose**: To avoid duplication by allowing one constructor to call another in the same class, thereby centralizing the common initialization tasks.
- **Usage**: A constructor delegates to another by using its initializer list to call a different constructor of the same class.

#### Example:
```cpp
class Widget {
public:
    Widget() : Widget(0, "default") {  // Delegates to the main constructor
        // additional initialization if needed
    }

    Widget(int id, std::string name) : id(id), name(name) {
        // perform initialization tasks
    }

private:
    int id;
    std::string name;
};
```
In this example, the default constructor delegates the initialization to a more complex constructor. This ensures that all instances are initialized consistently while keeping the code clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### Inherited Constructors

Inherited constructors enable a derived class to directly utilize the constructors of its base class, simplifying the code when extending classes that require access to the base class's constructor functionality.

#### How it Works:
- **Purpose**: To allow derived classes to inherit and expose the constructors of their base classes, making it easier to extend classes without having to redefine constructors that simply pass parameters to the base class.
- **Usage**: The derived class uses a `using` directive to indicate which base class constructors should be inherited.

#### Example:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base(int x) : value(x) {}
    Base(std::string str) : value(std::stoi(str)) {}
protected:
    int value;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    using Base::Base;  // Inherits all constructors from Base

    void display() const {
        std::cout << "Value: " << value << std::endl;
    }
};
```
In this example, `Derived` inherits the constructors from `Base`. This allows objects of `Derived` to be constructed using the constructors defined in `Base`, automatically initializing the `Base` part of `Derived` objects.

### Benefits of Using These Features:
- **Reduces Boilerplate Code**: Both features significantly reduce the need for boilerplate code by allowing constructors to reuse other constructors' implementations, whether within the same class or from a base class.
- **Enhances Maintainability**: Changes to common initialization logic need to be made in only one place, making the code easier to maintain.
- **Improves Readability**: Constructors that delegate or inherit are often simpler and more straightforward, improving the readability of the code.

Both delegating and inherited constructors enhance the expressiveness of C++ and are valuable tools for developers creating complex class hierarchies or requiring multiple constructor overloads in their classes.
