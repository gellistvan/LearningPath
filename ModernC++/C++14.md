## C++14
C++14 brought a number of smaller but still significant improvements and refinements to the features introduced in C++11, along with a few new features. Here's a detailed list of the features added in C++14:

### Language Features

1.  Binary literals and digit separators for improved readability of numeric literals.
2.  Generic lambdas (lambdas that use `auto` in the parameter declaration).
3.  Return type deduction for normal functions, allowing the use of `auto` to specify the return type.
4.  Decltype(auto), which allows `auto` to be used in the type specifier of the declaration or return type.
5.  Relaxed constexpr restrictions, expanding the types of expressions that can be evaluated at compile time.
6.  Deprecation of certain features, including `auto_ptr`, `random_shuffle`, and `bind1st/bind2nd`.
7.  Variable templates, allowing templates to be defined for variables in a similar way to function templates.
8.  Initialization of member variables in class definitions using curly braces or equals.
9.  Making `std::exception_ptr` copyable, and other minor improvements to exception handling.
10.  Sized deallocation, providing a way to pass the size of the object to deallocate to the deallocation function.
11.  [[deprecated]] attribute to mark entities as deprecated, generating a warning when they are used.

### Standard Library Features

1.  The introduction of `std::make_unique` as a safer alternative for creating unique pointers.
2.  `std::shared_timed_mutex` and `std::timed_mutex`, which are mutex types that support timed lock attempts.
3.  Extensions to `std::chrono`, including additional clocks and time point conversions.
4.  `std::integer_sequence` and `std::index_sequence`, utility classes to support metaprogramming.
5.  Tuple addressing by type, and expansions to `std::tuple` for easier usability.
6.  Expanded algorithms in the STL, including `std::copy_n` and others.
7.  Improvements to `std::function`, reducing its size and making it more efficient.
8.  Enhancements to the standard library containers and algorithms, incorporating noexcept specifications where appropriate.
9.  New standard library functions for `std::string` and `std::wstring`, including `stoi`, `stol`, `stoul`, etc., for conversions.
10.  Introduction of `std::quoted` for simpler I/O manipulations.

### Other Changes

1.  Numerous defect reports and small improvements based on community feedback.
2.  Enhanced support for newer programming methodologies and increased compatibility with different platforms and compilers.

C++14 aimed to make the language more user-friendly and efficient, and while it included fewer major features than C++11 or C++17, its refinements have been crucial for developers aiming to write cleaner and more maintainable code.
